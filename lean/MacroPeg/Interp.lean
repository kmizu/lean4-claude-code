# Macro PEG interpreter (fuel-based, total)

Mirrors `MDerives` 1:1, exactly as `Shallot.Peg.Interp.pegRun` mirrors
`Derives` — now parameterized by `Strategy`, mutual with `evalArgsPar` and
`evalArgsSeq` (the `.callByValuePar` / `.callByValueSeq` argument-evaluation
helpers). Same project-wide fuel convention: `none` means "out of fuel" and
nothing else; `some .fail` is a legitimate semantic outcome.

The `.call` case dispatches on `s`. Under `.callByName` it is structurally
identical to `.nt` in `pegRun`: look up the rule, recurse into the
(substituted) body at fuel `f` — matching `MDerives.callNameOk`/
`callNameFail`. Under `.callByValuePar`, `evalArgsPar` first evaluates every
actual parameter against the SAME `input` (never threading it — matching
`MDerives.DerivesArgsPar`); `some none` (some argument failed) becomes
`some .fail` for the call, `some (some vals)` recurses into the substituted
body from the UNCHANGED `input`, matching `MDerives.callParOk`/
`callParFail`/`callParArgFail`. Under `.callByValueSeq`, `evalArgsSeq`
evaluates the actual parameters SEQUENTIALLY, THREADING the input through
them (matching `MDerives.DerivesArgsSeq`); `some none` (some argument
failed) becomes `some .fail`, and `some (some (vals, mid))` recurses into
the substituted body from `mid` — the FINAL threaded position, NOT the
original `input` — matching `MDerives.callSeqOk`/`callSeqFail`/
`callSeqArgFail`.

`.param k` has a dead `some .fail` branch, exactly like `pegRun`'s dead
inner-`star` branch: unreachable once `subst` has fired at the enclosing
`call` (see `MacroPeg/Syntax.lean`), kept only so the pattern match is total.
`.callParam` is dead for the same reason. `.lam` is an unconditional
zero-width success, exactly like `.dbg`. `.invoke` mirrors `.call`'s
three-way `Strategy` dispatch (reusing `evalArgsPar`/`evalArgsSeq` as-is)
but has no "missing" branch — `arity`/`body` are already in hand, produced
by `subst` resolving a `.callParam`, never looked up.

/-- Monomorphic "prefix consumed before this known suffix" — computes `p`
such that `input = p ++ rest`, by walking `input` and comparing lengths at
each step (own recursion, not `List.take`, per the monomorphic-helpers
discipline; mirrors `mderives_suffix`'s existential on the `Derives`/proof
side, made computable here for the interpreter). If `rest` is not actually
a suffix of `input`, this still returns a defined (if meaningless) value —
callers here only ever apply it to a `rest` that `mpegRun` itself just
produced from `input`, so it is always a genuine suffix in practice. -/

the remaining `as` are run against `rest` (the position `a` left off at),

failed (so the whole call fails, see `mpegRun`'s `.call` case); `some (some

in order (each prefix taken relative to the position that argument started
at), and `final` the input remaining after the WHOLE list was threaded
through — the position `mpegRun` then derives the callee body from, unlike
`evalArgsPar` which returns no threaded remainder. -/
